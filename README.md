#### TODO:


If the access is not public or logged in:

While creating the river item, get all the users that have access to view the river item.
Then emit the msg to each others.

NodeJs should send that msg, to every user connected.

Otherwise, if the river item is for everybody, just display it.


##Visual.

Hide the river items and add a button to count new items.
